#Welcome to Grass Toucher's Trivia!

>In this project, we have created a website that enables the user to test and learn more about the environment. As you browse our site, you can find that we have three different topics to cover varying problems. On the home page you will be able to choose a quiz to test your knowledge. On the more info page, users can educate themself about topics they are interested in. Finally, we have a carbon heat map that shows the carbon emissions of different areas of the US. 

>We have learned various HTML techniques and combined them with CSS styling. Furthermore, we have used Javascript in order to implement our trivia program onto our website.
